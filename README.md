**Description**
This project was done for my Software Architecture class earlier this year. The purpose of the project was to go through the process of designing, implementing, presenting, and explaining software architecture. There was a list of topic to choose from, and I picked the Algae Forecaster project. The idea was to create a display for an algae forecaster system that displayed the levels of algae for every day in a 10 day period with a percent certainty. The goal of this implementation was to simulate a real-world system with the same functionality. To simulate a database, I chose to use a .json file. To simulate a display portal, I used a website.

**Technologies Used**
- React JS
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- JSON
- Git

**Reason behind using React JS over other frameworks**
I wanted to gain more experience with React JS because my experience was quite limited at the time.

**Result**
The result of this project is a fully functional algae forecast data display interface. The website updates everything in real-time. For example, if I were to change a number or name in the JSON file, it would update it on screen immediately. The website is dynamic, so if I were to add a new lake or remove a lake, it would be as simple as removing them from the JSON file. I also implemented a last updated clock that shows when the website was last updated with new data.
